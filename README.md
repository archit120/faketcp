# faketcp
* This is a fake TCP protocol on Link-layer. It implements the handshakes like TCP but no retranmission after link connected(like UDP).
* It's already used in [pangolin](https://github.com/archit120/pangolin), which provides same performance with UDP and avoids some UDP issues in VPN.
* Using method can be found in [example](https://github.com/archit120/faketcp/tree/master/example).
* Only supported in Linux.
